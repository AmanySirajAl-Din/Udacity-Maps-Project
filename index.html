	<!-- To load Google Maps in my site -->
	<!-- Simply By Adding three things into my code  -->

	<!-- the First -->
	<!-- a script line into my HTML to load the API -->
    <!-- load the JS API -->
	<script async defer
        src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBJeAcMu__TdDZtMNYZ4tBD6uSgIn97dis&v=3&callback=initMap">
    </script>
    <!-- this loads the JS definitions when the page starts loading in the browser -->
    <!-- loading the JS her asynchronously which means -->
    <!-- that the rest of the page will render while the JS API loads -->
    <!-- and our callback fun (initMap) will excute when the API is done loading -->
    
    <!-- maps.googleapis.com is the endpoint that we're loading the JS from -->
    <!-- the prameter v-3 indicates that we're calling version 3 of the API -->
